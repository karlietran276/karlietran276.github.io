          <p>
            Hi, my name is Karlie Tran, and I am originally from Hanoi, Vietnam. I came to the United States when I was 16 years old and have been navigating life as an international student and professional ever since. After 7.5 years as an international student, I transitioned to working under an H-1B visa starting in 2022/2023.
          </p>

          <div class="inline-content">
            <p>
              I began my academic journey at the University at Buffalo, where I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance and Data Management. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led me to pivot to a new path—pursuing a Master of Education in Higher Education and Student Affairs. I was an Assistant Hall Director in Campus Living at the University at Buffalo for two years.

          </div>

          <p>
            Currently, I serve as a Hall Coordinator at the University of Iowa. This position, however, was not an easy milestone to achieve. During my first professional job search, I applied to over 60 positions and participated in more than 50 interviews. This challenging process inspired me to create a Job Search Toolkit—a resource to help me track and organize my applications and interviews efficiently.

              As an international candidate, I faced unique obstacles, particularly around visa sponsorship. Often, rejections were not due to my qualifications but the complexities of visa requirements. I understand firsthand the challenges of conducting a nationwide job search, especially when navigating non-negotiable needs like sponsorship.

          <p>
            The Job Search Organizer is your ultimate solution for staying on top of your job applications. Designed to help you track opportunities, application statuses, follow-ups, and deadlines with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            This toolkit includes four key documents:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Master Resume Template</strong> &ndash; A foundational resume format that allows you to keep track of all your work experience, skills, and achievements in one place. This serves as a comprehensive reference to easily tailor your resume for each job application.</li>
            <li><strong>Master Cover Letter Template</strong> &ndash; A structured guide that helps you prepare paragraphs based on your strengths, making it easier to customize your cover letter for each job description while aligning it with your skills and experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Common Interview Questions</strong> &ndash; Focused on Higher Education &amp; Student Affairs but useful for any industry.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Search Organizer</strong> &ndash; A comprehensive tracker for job applications, interviews, and follow-ups.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Inside the Job Search Organizer</h3>
          <p>
            The Job Search Organizer is the heart of this toolkit, designed to help you track and manage your applications efficiently. It includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Research Tab</strong> &ndash; Keep track of all job postings, including company details, application deadlines, and job descriptions.</li>
            <li><strong>Dashboard Tab</strong> &ndash; An automatically populated summary of your job search progress, pulling key details from the Research Tab.</li>
            <li><strong>Job Search Criteria Tab</strong> &ndash; Define your non-negotiables, such as salary expectations, location, work-life balance, and organizational values, before starting your job search.</li>
            <li><strong>Interview Answer Organizer</strong> &ndash; A dedicated space to structure and store responses to common interview questions using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).</li>
            <li><strong>Follow-Up Questions Tab</strong> &ndash; Pre-sorted questions to ask during an interview to gain deeper insights into the role, company culture, and expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Response Templates</strong> &ndash; Ready-to-use email templates for common job search communications, such as application follow-ups and thank-you notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Negotiation &amp; Interview Reference List</strong> &ndash; A place to document key points for salary negotiation and keep track of critical interview questions.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            While this toolkit is pre-filled with industry-specific information tailored to Higher Education and Student Affairs, it is fully customizable to fit any industry and job seeker. You can modify it to match your personal preferences, career goals, and specific job search needs.
          </p>
          <h3>How to Use This Toolkit</h3>
          <p>
            Once you gain access to the toolkit, I highly recommend downloading and personalizing it to fit your needs. You can trim down sections that may not apply to your search or expand areas that require more detail. The more you tailor it to your personal job search strategy, the more effective it will be in helping you stay organized and prepared.

        <article id="h1b">
          <h2 class="major">Cap-Exempt H-1B</h2>

          <h3>What is a Cap-Exempt Employer?</h3>
          <p>
            A <strong>cap-exempt employer</strong> is an organization not subject to the annual H-1B visa cap or lottery, allowing them to sponsor H-1B workers year-round without restriction. These employers typically fall into one of the following categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Higher Education Institutions</strong> &ndash; Universities and colleges, such as Harvard University or the University of California system.</li>
            <li><strong>Nonprofit Organizations Affiliated with Higher Education</strong> &ndash; Research centers or academic medical centers directly linked to universities.</li>
            <li><strong>Nonprofit Research Organizations</strong> &ndash; Entities engaged in scientific or medical research, like the Mayo Clinic or Scripps Research Institute.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Research Organizations</strong> &ndash; Institutions conducting public research, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or NASA research centers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            However, many of these institutions reserve H-1B visa sponsorship for <strong>professors, doctors, faculty, and high-level administrators</strong>. Employers tend to be more selective about which staff positions they are willing to sponsor, making it crucial for international candidates to conduct thorough research.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Research H-1B Sponsorship Opportunities</h3>
          <p>
            As an international candidate, there are a few steps you can take to understand an institution’s stance on H-1B sponsorship:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Read the institution’s policy on H-1B visa sponsorship</strong> – Some universities and research institutions publicly outline their sponsorship policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Search <a href="https://h1bdata.info/" target="_blank">H1BData.info</a></strong> – This website provides historical H-1B sponsorship data by employer and job category.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It’s important to remember:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Just because an institution has never sponsored a position you’re applying for doesn’t mean they won’t sponsor now.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Just because an institution has previously sponsored a similar position doesn’t mean they will continue to do so.</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The best way to get a definitive answer is to <strong>apply and ask the hiring manager directly</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3>When Should You Ask About H-1B Sponsorship?</h3>
          <p>
            Different job seekers use different strategies when asking about visa sponsorship:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Before applying or in the first interview</strong> – Saves time if sponsorship is non-negotiable.</li>
            <li><strong>Before the final interview</strong> – Allows you to gauge interest and suitability before bringing up sponsorship.</li>
            <li><strong>After receiving an offer</strong> – Some candidates wait until they secure an offer before discussing visa needs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Personally, I have tried all three approaches, and there is no clear-cut best strategy. I have encountered institutions that openly confirmed sponsorship even before I applied, and others that extended an offer but later rescinded it due to sponsorship restrictions.
          </p>

          <h3>Choosing the Best Strategy for You</h3>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the right timing depends on your <strong>mental and physical capacity</strong>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you have the energy to go through multiple interview rounds and risk disappointment later, you may choose to wait.</li>
            <li>If you prefer to avoid unnecessary hurdles and potential setbacks, ask early.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is no right or wrong approach—<strong>do what works best for you</strong>.
